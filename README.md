This documentation is meant to provide a resource for those at UiO interested in working with computer modeling 
and data analysis in Earth Sciences. It provides information on software tools available for data analysis 
and scientific program for projects within the field of Geosciences in general and to provide users a central 
resource for keeping notes on UIO specific aspects of running various software routines. 
Ideally, this site will become overtime a 'go to' location where incoming students who will be working 
with modeling and heavy data analysis on servers can find tips for getting started.


Content herein is generally specific to UiO, as otherwise it is recommended to make posts to [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/sites)
 and the sites therein.

This documentation uses [RST](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) and build documentation with 
[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).
 Note that in some cases, the content does not yet exist, in which case you are encouraged to edit and add 
 information, or contact one of the site maintainers to request further information.
