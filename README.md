 Geosciences Modeling Documentation
 

The documentation is meant to replace what was available as part of the [GEO-IT wiki](https://wiki.uio.no/mn/geo/geoit/index.php/Welcome_to_Geosciences_Modeling_Wiki). The main objective is to allow students, PhDs, postdocs and researchers to actively write and update the documentation for activities related to Geodciences Modeling.

If you do not like to update the documentation online and prefer to use your favorite editor locally on your machine/laptop, you can skip step-3 and 4 and then clone your forked repository to edit the files locally. Once pushed to your forked github repository, you can create a pull request and propose your changes.
